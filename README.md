<h1>Simple JavaScript Calculator</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was developed as part of my personal journey to improve my JavaScript skills. It is a basic implementation that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction.</p>
    
<p>The primary goal of this project was to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical operations.</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
    <li>HTML for structuring the calculator</li>
    <li>CSS for styling the layout</li>
    <li>JavaScript for implementing the calculator logic</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clone this repository</strong> to your local machine:
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/iuryzanardi/Js_Calculator.git</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Navigate to the project directory</strong>:
            <pre><code>cd Js_Calculator</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Open the <code>index.html</code> file</strong> in your browser to start using the calculator.</li>
        <li><strong>Perform basic operations</strong> like addition, subtraction by clicking the respective buttons. The result will be displayed immediately.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>DOM Manipulation: I focused on interacting with elements and updating the UI dynamically based on user input.</li>
    <li>Event Handling: The calculator reacts to button clicks, allowing users to perform calculations.</li>
    <li>Working with Functions: I practiced creating and organizing functions for different actions, such as handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying the results.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>While this project is simple, there are several areas for improvement that I plan to work on in the future:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Advanced Operations: Add functionality for more complex calculations such as divisions, percentages, multiplications, square roots, powers, or trigonometric functions.</li>
    <li>Error Handling: Implement checks for invalid input or operations (e.g., division by zero).</li>
    <li>Keyboard Support: Allow users to use their keyboard to input numbers and operations.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design: Make the calculator more mobile-friendly.</li>
</ul>
