Simple JavaScript Calculator
Overview
This is a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was developed as part of my personal journey to improve my JavaScript skills. It is a basic implementation that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition snf subtraction.

The primary goal of this project was to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical operations.

Technologies Used
HTML for structuring the calculator
CSS for styling the layout
JavaScript for implementing the calculator logic

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
cd simple-calculator
Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the calculator.
Perform basic operations like addition and subtraction by clicking the respective buttons. The result will be displayed immediately.

Learning Goals
DOM Manipulation: I focused on interacting with elements and updating the UI dynamically based on user input.
Event Handling: The calculator reacts to button clicks, allowing users to perform calculations.
Working with Functions: I practiced creating and organizing functions for different actions, such as handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying the results.

Future Improvements
While this project is simple, there are several areas for improvement that I plan to work on in the future:

Advanced Operations: Add functionality for more complex calculations such as divisions, percentages, multiplications, square roots, powers, or trigonometric functions.
Error Handling: Implement checks for invalid input or operations (e.g., division by zero).
Keyboard Support: Allow users to use their keyboard to input numbers and operations.
Responsive Design: Make the calculator more mobile-friendly.
